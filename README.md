# Posterior Inference for Periodic Signals
This project explores Bayesian inference techniques to recover latent periodic signals from noisy time-series observations. The methods are demonstrated on synthetic data and extended to real-world Kepler space telescope light curves, illustrating how Bayesian tools can uncover periodicities in stellar brightness due to rotation or oscillation.

## üåü Problem Statement
Given a noisy time-series signal: $y_i = f(t_i) + \epsilon_i$
where, $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma ^2)$

the task is to infer the true periodic function f(t) and obtain posterior distributions over its parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, phase).

## üíª Applications
The approach is applied to two Kepler targets:

- Quiet Star (KIC 007596240): A simple harmonic model is fit to the true flux values to capture baseline periodicity.

- Rotating Star (KIC 007609553): A more flexible K=2 harmonic model is used to infer f(t) from observed flux, accounting for rotational modulation and multi-harmonic structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods Used
The notebook demonstrates:

1. Modeling Periodic Signals
- Synthetic sinusoidal signals
- Kepler light curves with rotational or oscillatory behavior

2. Bayesian Inference Pipeline
- Likelihood and priors
- Posterior computation via:
- - Grid evaluation
- - MCMC sampling (emcee)

3. Harmonic Modeling
- Simple sinusoidal model: $A.\sin (2 \pi \omega t + \phi)$
- Harmonic expansion (K > 1) for capturing richer periodic behavior

4. Visualization
- Posterior heatmaps and confidence contours
- Trace plots and histograms from MCMC
- Overlay of inferred signal over raw and smoothed data
